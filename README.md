Treehouse is WordPress theme/plugin collection which houses a lot of functionality in plugins so users can easily switch a theme without losing access to things like custom-post-types.

This is the core plugin that houses all shared classes and handles a lot of interaction with WordPress itself. 
This plugin is required in order for the other themes and plugins in the Treehouse collection to function properly.
